A SIMPLE PHP BLOG


HOW IT WORKS
============

Folder structure:
    src/
    -- files/
    -- source/
    -- article.php
    -- index.php
    -- info.php
    -- style.css
    -- toc.php

Copy the content of src/ folder to the web server folder

To create a new article, go to 'source/' folder, and create a .html file named like:
    YYYYMMDDHHMM.html (ex. 201911111030.html for 2019-11-11 10:30)

Then, in the file, create the article title as:
    <h2>Article Title</h2>

and the article content written in HTML.
And it's done.


If it is necessary to insert an image to the article, put the image in 'files/' folder,
and in the source txt file, insert this:

    <img src="files/filename.jpeg" alt="simple image description">
    <span class="img-description">image description</span>


To customize the blog:
    => edit the style.css
    => edit the index.php/article.php files for structure
    => edit the info.php to edit blog metadata
       - blog title, author, description, translation, and more

To add/replace a favicon, insert a favicon.ico file in the files/ folder.
If the favicon file as another name, change the file name and type in info.php file.


FEATURES
========

This is a simple blog written in PHP, but has some "complex" features, like:

    => homepage (index.php) only show 10 articles by default;
        (This can be changed in the info.php)

    => each article has is own page, using php sessions, and $_GET['id'];

    => because the homepage lists only 10 articles (by default), there is
        a toc.php page with all articles listed;
